/* "Templates for TemplaVoila reloaded" v1.0 (c) by Dieter Bunkerd (http://typo3-asia.com)
 * This file exists only to keep the function alive which is provided by the color choser at install time.
 * I did'nt want to simply remove it, because it is a nice feature,
 * but content.css is simply too complex to let that script edit the colors automatically.  
 * For production sites however, you should NOT import this, but rather edit the "real" .css files.
